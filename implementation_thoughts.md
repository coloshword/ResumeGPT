### Implementation Goals
- 01/13/25: Implement a very basic backend, allowing for API calls to an LLM, and a "Chat" interface frontend 
    - first very basic endpoint finished
    - next step? Incorporate a very simple frontend to send messages to the server 
        - ignore react for now, super simple webpage to send a chat 


TODO:
- make sure you use npm project next time
<cot>
    - the next step? include submit button, and add it to the flex box
    - we have a script tag, add a document.queryselector

    - if pressed, send the chat to the text 

    - chat is now there 
    - now the idea is to make sure we send this chat to an endpoint
